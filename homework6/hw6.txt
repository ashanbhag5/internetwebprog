What is PHP? What do server side languages do in web development?

PHP is a server-side scripting language used to create dynamic web pages by processing data, interacting with databases, and generating HTML.

Server-side languages handle tasks like processing user input, managing databases, controlling sessions, and securing websites, 
all of which occur on the server before the content is sent to the user's browser.

2. What are some examples of how PHP and JavaScript are alike and how they differ?
PHP and JavaScript are alike in several ways. Both are scripting languages used for web development and allow for dynamic content generation, 
with PHP working on the server-side and JavaScript on the client-side. They also share similar syntax elements, such as variables, loops, and conditional 
statements.

However, they differ in key areas. PHP runs on the server, while JavaScript runs in the browser. PHP is primarily used for back-end tasks 
like interacting with databases, whereas JavaScript is mainly for front-end tasks like handling user interface events. Additionally, JavaScript
 can directly manipulate HTML and CSS, while PHP generates HTML that is sent to the browser.


3. Why pick PHP over another server side scripting language?
 PHP is widely adopted, offering extensive community support, documentation, and a variety of frameworks like Laravel to speed up development. It integrates easily with databases, 
 particularly MySQL, making it ideal for data-driven applications.


4. What’s the difference between the include and require keywords in PHP?
include: If the file is missing or not found, include generates a warning but allows the script to continue executing.
require: If the file is missing or not found, require generates a fatal error and stops the execution of the script immediately.


a. What would happen if you tried to use a variable from a file that hasn’t been
included yet?
If you try to use a variable from a file that hasn't been included yet in PHP, an undefined variable error or notice will occur. Since the file containing the variable was not included,
 PHP won't recognize the variable, leading to a warning or error indicating that the variable does not exist in the current scope.


5. Compare and contrast echo and var_dump.

echo: It is used to output simple strings or variables. It doesn't provide any type or detailed information about the data; it just prints the value.
var_dump: It provides a detailed output that includes the data type and value. It’s useful for debugging because it shows arrays, objects, and even NULL values in full detail.
