1. What is SQL? MySQL? What are relational databases?

SQL (Structured Query Language): It's a language designed to interact with relational databases. 
It's used to manipulate, retrieve, and manage data within these databases. Common SQL operations include:

MySQL: It's a popular open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses SQL to interact with data. 
It's widely used for web applications and other database-driven systems.

Relational Databases: These databases organize data into tables, with rows representing records and columns representing fields. 
Tables are linked together using relationships, allowing you to efficiently store and retrieve complex data.

2. What is normalization in SQL?

Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and dependency, making it more efficient 
and consistent. It involves breaking down large tables into smaller, more focused tables and defining relationships between them. The goal is to minimize data anomalies and improve data integrity.

3. What are primary and foreign keys?



Primary Key: A unique identifier for a record in a table. It cannot contain null values and must be unique 
within the table. It's often used to establish relationships with other tables.

Foreign Key: A column in one table that references the primary key of another table. It creates a link between 
the two tables, defining a relationship.

4.  What are the three relationship types?

One-to-One: A single record in one table is related to exactly one record in another table.
One-to-Many: A single record in one table is related to multiple records in another table.
Many-to-Many: Multiple records in one table can be related to multiple records in another table. This relationship 
is often implemented using a junction table.

5. What is the difference between a left join and an inner join?

Inner Join: Returns rows that have matching values in both tables. If there's no match, the row is not included in the result.
Left Join: Returns all rows from the left table, and the matched rows from the right table. If there's no match in the right table, 
null values are returned for the right table's columns.
In essence, a left join includes all records from the left table, while an inner join only includes records that 
have matches in both tables.
