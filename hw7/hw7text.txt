1. Class is blueprint for creating objects, defines the properties
behaviors that objects of that class will have

Object is an instance of a class, can interact with object by calling
its methods and accessing its properties

OOP is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept
of objects

2.Abstract class is used when you want to define a base class that represents
a general concept but should not be instantiated on its own.
Provide common interface and shared functionality

3. Superglobals are predefined variables in PHP that are 
accessible from any part of a script. Used to collect data
$_Get - used to collect data sent in the url of a request
$_Post - used to collect data sent in an http post request
$_Session - used to store information about a user session across
$_Cookie - used to store small amounts of data on the client's computer
$_Server - contains information about server and execution root 
Setting up and using a class via namespaces in PHP:

4.
Step 1: Define the namespace at the top of the PHP file where the class is declared.
Step 2: Import and instantiate the class using the use keyword followed by the namespace, .

MVC (Model-View-Controller):

Model: Manages the data, logic, and rules of the application, often interacting with the database.
View: Represents the user interface, displaying data to users and receiving user input.
Controller: Acts as an intermediary between the Model and View, handling user input, updating the Model, and returning the View.

<?php 
class Person {
    private $name;
    private $age;
    public function __construct($name, $age){
        $this->name = $name;
        $this->age = $age;
    }

    public function getName(){
        return $this->name;
    }
    public function getAge(){
        return $this->age;
    }
    public function setName($name){
        $this->name = $name;
    }
    public function setAge($Age){
        $this->age = $age;
    }

    public static function greet(){
